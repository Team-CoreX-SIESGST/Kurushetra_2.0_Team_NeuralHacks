This document can be used to test the text processing capabilities of the system. It should be extracted properly and converted to JSON format, with the option to generate AI summaries using the integrated RAG system.

The system should recognize this as a text file and extract:
- Full content
- Word count
- Character count
- Line count
- File metadata

This serves as a baseline test case for the file processing pipeline.
