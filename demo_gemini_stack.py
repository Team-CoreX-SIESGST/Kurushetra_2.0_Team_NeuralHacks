Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by providing intelligent solutions 
for diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. Key applications include:

## Medical Imaging
AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy, often detecting 
abnormalities that human radiologists might miss.

## Drug Discovery
Machine learning models accelerate the drug discovery process by predicting molecular 
behavior and identifying potential therapeutic compounds.

## Personalized Medicine
AI enables personalized treatment plans based on individual patient data, genetic 
information, and treatment history.

## Clinical Decision Support
Intelligent systems assist healthcare providers in making evidence-based decisions 
by analyzing vast amounts of medical literature and patient data.

The integration of AI in healthcare promises to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, 
and enhance the overall quality of medical care."""
